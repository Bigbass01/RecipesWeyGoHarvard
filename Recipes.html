              <h3>How to make a classic Italian Spaghetti wey go Harvard</h3>
              <p>
                Making a classic Italian spaghetti is easier than you think, and
                it starts with fresh ingredients and a bit of patience. Begin by
                boiling your pasta in salted water until al dente. While that's
                cooking, heat olive oil in a pan and sauté garlic and onions
                until fragrant. Add crushed tomatoes, a pinch of sugar, oregano,
                basil, salt, and pepper, then let it simmer gently to deepen the
                flavor. Toss the drained spaghetti into the sauce and let it
                absorb the goodness for a few minutes. Finish with freshly
                grated Parmesan cheese and a sprinkle of chopped parsley for
                that authentic Italian touch. Simple, rich, and comforting.

              <h3>How to make Fluffy Pancakes wey go Harvard</h3>
              <p>
                For irresistibly fluffy pancakes wey go Harvard, start by
                whisking together your dry ingredients: flour, sugar, baking
                powder, and a pinch of salt. In a separate bowl, beat eggs, then
                add milk, melted butter, and a splash of vanilla extract.
                Combine the wet and dry ingredients gently — don't overmix; a
                few lumps are fine! Let the batter rest for about 5–10 minutes
                to activate the baking powder. Heat a lightly greased pan over
                medium heat and pour in the batter using a ladle or measuring
                cup. Cook until bubbles form on the surface, then flip and cook
                until golden. Stack high, drizzle with syrup or honey, and enjoy
                your cloud-like pancakes! Watch the video below.
